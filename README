generate-msbuild
================

NAnt task that generates a Visual Studio project from a NAnt build file.

Usage instructions
------------------

Add <generate-msbuild /> as the first element under <project> in your NAnt build file. Place the GenerateMsBuildTask.dll in /extensions/common/neutral/ subfolder of your project. Run your build normally, and generate-msbuild will record it and save as a Visual Studio 2010 build file. If project files already exist, they will be updated with settings captured during the NAnt build.

Missing things
--------------

* more testing (done on NAnt, CruiseControl.Net and Boo so far)

Possible extensions
--------------

* mapping for less common csc settings (added as I encounter projects using them)
* more NAnt tasks supported by translation
