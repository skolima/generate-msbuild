generate-msbuild
================

NAnt task that generates a Visual Studio project from a NAnt build file.

Usage instructions
------------------

Add <generate-msbuild /> as the first thing under <project> in your NAnt build file. Run your build normally, and generate-msbuild will record it and save as a Visual Studio 2010 build file.

Missing things
--------------

* project dependencies
* master solution file
* more testing

Possible extensions
--------------

* update the projects instead of overwriting them
* relative paths instead of absolute so the generated files can be shared
* mapping for less common csc settings (added as I encounter projects using them)
* more NAnt tasks supported by translation
